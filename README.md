# Honey-rae-api
API to the 2nd REACT project we did in NSS
This project uses an external API that is only using javascript to have a basic database structure. 
FEEL FREE to explore the database and its menial columns and rows. Storing user information, accounts, orders, etc is all done within this custom API.
